# Sunset Image Storage and Retrieval System

## Project Overview

This project implements an image storage database and retrieval system specifically designed for sunset photographs. The system allows users to store, manage, and search for sunset images using various features and criteria.

## System Components

### 1. Image Database
- Structured storage for sunset images
- Metadata management
- Image feature extraction and indexing
- Support for multiple image formats

### 2. Retrieval System
- Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)
- Feature-based search capabilities
- Similar image finding
- Query optimization

## Dataset

The system uses a sunset image dataset from Kaggle available in two formats:
1. [CSV Format](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oduythng/295sunset-csv) - Contains image metadata
2. [Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oduythng/295sunset-csdldpt) - Contains the actual sunset images

## Features

- Image upload and storage
- Feature extraction from images
- Fast image retrieval
- Similar image search
- Image metadata management
- User-friendly interface for search operations

## Technologies Used

- Image processing libraries
- Database management system
- Feature extraction algorithms
- Search optimization techniques
